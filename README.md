# Project Architecture

## Overview
The project aims to generate artistic depictions of GIFs using existing mathematical visualization code. The project will be implemented using Python and Node.js. The neural network will be trained using scikit-learn and TensorFlow. GANs and Adversarial networks will be used to generate random parameters to the mathematical code to generate thousands of GIFs. The output will be stored in a database. The project will be processed using a pipeline.
